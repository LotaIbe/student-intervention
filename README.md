Supervised learning to identify students who might need early intervention before they fail to graduate

<br> 
The goal of this project is to predict whether a student is going to be successful in their academics or not. Given a student, we would like to assign the categories `pass(1)` and `not pass(0)` to that student, so that teachers and other people could administer early interventions.
